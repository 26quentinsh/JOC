    <div class="desc">The sun is powered by nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion reactions on the sun happen multiple times per second and can be 10s of thousands of degrees.</div>

    <div class="desc">In a fusion reaction, two light nuclei merge to form a single heavier nucleus. The process releases energy because the total mass of the resulting single nucleus is less than the mass of the two original nuclei. The leftover mass becomes energy.</div>

    <div class="desc">One way to control the intensely hot plasma is to use powerful magnets. The most advanced device for this is the ‘tokamak’, a Russian word for a ring-shaped magnetic chamber. CCFE’s goal is to develop fusion reactors using the tokamak concept.</div>

    <div class="desc">This is a fusion reactor. Fusion reacors create a safe controlled environment in which fusion reaction can occur. We could not figure out how to make fusion reactors until recent years.</div>

    <div class="desc">One of my favourite projects we did this year was the American idols part 2 project. In this project, I created a gif where I edited pictures of different foods into the dogs mouth. I had to create individual frames and piece them together to get my final project.</div>

    <div class="desc">This was the I am collage project. This project was very enjoyable for me because I was able to make a collage that included pictures of some of my biggest insperations and interests. This project was fun, not very difficult, and was definitely one of my favorite project of the year.</div>
